# Fusion App

Fusion is a business networking application designed to connect business professionals using a swipe feature and through advanced matching algorithms including geohashing and linear regression. 

## Motivation

I created a platform to connect business professionals, entrepreneurs, investors, mentors to develop mutually beneficial connections, launch businesses, exchange ideas that go beyond traditional constraints. Traditional networking methods can often fall short, lacking efficiency and the ability to forge meaningful connections. Fusion resolves these issues by integrating card swiping and sophisticated matching algorithms.
